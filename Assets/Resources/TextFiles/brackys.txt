Take 32, because apparently I can't get this intro cut down to under 30 minutes So, hello welcome to the first tutorial done by Brackeys. I am the CEO of Brackeys and today, I'm going to show you how to create a survival game

this is probably going to be a whole series because this can't be done in just one single tutorial and yes, let's see where this brings us, so I have opened up a new Unity project, it's completely empty and you can just do this by going to File and new project and I did not Import any assets

So, this tutorial is for the beginner to the Intermediate, mostly for beginners, and then we'll move on to the other parts later So okay, let's start out by creating a ground plane for our character to move on this is going to be a first person game

so go to game object, create other and then cube and let's make sure that this is in the center of the scene by going to a transform on the right hand side and zeroing out the x y and z transform. So by simply highlighting the cube in the hierarchy and then

Taking my mouse to the perspective view and pressing F it will zoom in on the highlighted objects All right, now let's scale this on the x to about 50, on the y you can just leave that at 1 and the z to again 50. So now we have quite a huge

ground plane for a character to stand on. Let's go to hierarchy on the left hand side rename this to Ground Plane Make sure that you notice that Unity is cap sensitive So I type everything in one word with every word starting with a capital letter, but
